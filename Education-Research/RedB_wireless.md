# Epert Wireless Penetration Testing Services
Onsite Wireless Penetration Testing
Wireless Penetration Testing is a proactive step your company can take to ensure the security of your wireless networks. Redbot Security industry’s most comprehensive onsite wireless security testing.

# Phase 1 of Redbot Security Wireless Testing is Wireless Reconnaissance of the organization’s wireless infrastructure to identify the locations of wireless access points. We identify the number of access points, and types of encryption used, as well as construct graphical representations of this data so that it can be easily conveyed.

  Phase 2 Redbot Security Provides Rogue Access Point Detection identifying any rogue access point attached to the network. These can be in the form of devices employees have brought into work or malicious devices planted on the wired network.

# Phase 3 Redbot Security Deploys Wireless Encryption Cracking  Techniques that will attempt to crack any weak encryption methods being used in the wireless implementations. Weak encryptions included WEP and WPA-PSK. The goal of this phase of the assessment is to demonstrate deficiencies via these weak encryption and to provide suggestions towards improving the security of the wireless implementation.

  Phase 4 of our onsite assessment is critical and can only be effectively preformed onsite. Wireless Client-based Attacks are deployed,  leveraging weaknesses in the client in an attempt to gain access to the wireless network. Redbot Security will deploy a rogue access point that will capture usernames and passwords in real-time.   In addition, Redbot Security will setup (if WPA2/Enterprise is being used) a rogue access point that will crack the passwords of any clients that connect to it.
