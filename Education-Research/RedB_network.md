We perform manual controlled pen-testing â€“ exploiting real world vulnerabilities for external and internal networks from a remote perspective.

Remote Network Penetration Testing
Internal Penetration Testing is a proactive step your company can take to ensure the security of your internal networks. Redbot Security will perform the following steps:

# Reconnaissance and Enumeration focuses on trying to identify targets for the assessment using passive means. For the internal assessment, we will use sniffing tools to identify unencrypted services such as FTP and Telnet as well as passwords or other sensitive data/credentials being passed in clear-text.

# Network Surveying and Services Identification is the process of using methods such as port scanning, service and OS fingerprinting, and vulnerability scanning. This will help Redbot Security identify open ports, protocols and services throughout the environment and enumerate the attack surface. During this phase Redbot Security will fingerprint and catalog versioning information on all protocols and services available as well as any present vulnerabilities.

# Network Penetration Testing will use the data gathered in previous phases to develop an attack plan. The attack plan will consist of version and signature-based vulnerabilities, manually identified and chained attacks, as well as other attacks identified by the testers. Furthermore, the attack plan and execution can be tailored to account for organization-specific threat agents. The attack plan is then executed focusing on gaining access to systems and data. Once initial access is gained the goal shifts to escalate privileges to make the attack more pervasive and gain access to sensitive assets and information.

# Password Cracking is typically conducted in conjunction with the network penetration testing phase. Services with authenticated logins are tested against a dynamic username and password list tailored to the organization based on information gathered in previous phases and industry password security trends. The goal of this aspect of the assessment is to obtain access to services and devices that are not available through configuration error and/or vulnerability exploitation.

# Root Cause Analysis and Reporting for compiling the results of the penetration testing and building comprehensive findings for all issues found. Redbot Security will provide analysis and reporting of each identified risk with documented attack chains and proofs-of-concept (PoCs).
