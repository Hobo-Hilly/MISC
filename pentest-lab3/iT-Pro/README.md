# Ep. 3 with Don and Dan
# Redirection

# This episode is all about redirecting file input and output. We FINALLY get to learn about | Pipe! 

# What is redirection?
	- Redirection is taking a command and redirecting it to something else. 
 	- This is typically a file but NOT always.
	- This is an example of output redirection.

# The symbol used is the greater than sign " > " or the Alligator Jaws (A.J)

	Ex: ~$ command > file

	* If you type in a file that isnt there it will create one for you.

# Example

	* stdout = Standard output

	Ex: ~$ date > datefile.txt
	~$ cat datefile.txt
	output: { whatever the date is }

# Remmber the whole reason we have scripting is to take repetitive tasks and automate them to make life easier.

# Commands typically take arguments

# Example - Using a file to redirect the output into a command I want to run.
	We will be using the AJ's but this time they are facing the otherway.

	* Ex:~$ command < {Name of file}

	* This is an example of input redirection.

# WC command example. We are redirecting the output of this file to the input of the command :~$ wc

	* Ex:~$ wc < {Name of file}

# Not EVERY command is able to receive input. wc is ready to receive input but some commands cannot do this.
	- Some are interactive and have prompts to them.



# Example -From command line redirection These a Croccidile jams. They are bigger than the AJ's hence the two arrows and not one.

	*Ex: ~$ command << inline input redir

	*Ex: ~$ command << EOF  - These are both very typical(EOF is called a text 
marker)	

	*Ex: ~$ wc << EOF
>string 1
>string 2
>string 3
>EOF

# EOF = End Of File
	-This lets the program know that it can stop reading/ looking for commands.
	- You can technichally put the word bumpercars(or any other word you choose) in place of EOF to let the command know that it has reached the end of the input. So that the file can start showing said input.
	- WATCH OUT the reason we use the EOF is so that other people who may work with the file know whats going on. ... IF I want them too. :)




# How Commands work together... FINALLY PIPING! Exaplained! :)
	-This is how we are able to make commands work together.

	* Explanation: If a plumber wants to join this spigot to this spigot/
	or this sink to this drain. He takes a pipe and he connects them.
	so that everything works and flows into a desired output.

	* Piping is no different. To do this we simply use the PIPE character.
	" | " 

	* piping is extremly powerful (as I suspected). It gives us the abillity
	to take the output of one command and send it in as input of another 
	command. All without ever touching a file.

	
	Ex:~$ command | command2 | command3

	Ex:~$ cat file | less

Ff: /etc/ is where all the config files live in a linux environment.

Ff2: greg is also powerful and is often used with piping

Ff3: fstab is "file system tables"
	
	Ex:~$ ls -la /etc | grep fstab | wc

	stdout:~$ 1    9   53

	* So this command has listed the files in /etc/ 
	* It greped looking for fstab
	* grep got it's info from the ls command before it.
	* pipe joined these together and then pipe joins this with wc


	- So we were able to get the info we were looking for by piping 
	these things together. Giving us the desired output.

	- google bash one liners to see this stuff really at work. GTFOBins
NOTE: Command chaining is NOT piping. Command chaining uses the ' ; ' 
      which is not the same thing as piping.
