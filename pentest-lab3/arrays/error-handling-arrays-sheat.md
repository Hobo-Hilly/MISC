Use Error Handling and Arrays

One of the common methods is to insert and unexpected input that can generate an error condition. Therefore, to avoid such a situation, developers should use the error-handling methods. Bash provides an alternate method instead of try…catch clause.

Use Error Handling

Many programming languages use the try…catch clause to handle errors. However, if you are using Bash to write shell scripts, then you will not be able to use try…catch clause. Instead, you can use && or ||. The && operator is the AND operator, which requires both the expressions in the command to be true. The first expression is a command, which must run for the second command to run. If the first command fails, the second command will not run.

The || operator is the OR operator. In this case, if the first command fails, then only the second command runs.

To learn about error handling, perform the following steps:
Step 1

Clear the screen by entering the following command:

clear

Let’s first try the AND operator. Remember, the first command must run for the second command to run. If the first command fails, then the second command will not run.

Type the following command:

cd test && touch plab.txt

Press Enter.

Step 2

Notice the output of this command. There is no directory named test, and therefore, the first command fails. Since you are using the AND operator, the second command does not execute.

Step 3

Clear the screen by entering the following command:

clear

Let’s try the OR operator. Type the following command:

Type the following command:

cd test || touch plab.txt

Press Enter.

Step 4

Notice that the first command fails in this scenario. However, the second should have executed and created the plab.txt file.

Step 5

Let’s verify if the plab.txt file has been created with the touch command. To do this, type the following command:

ls -l

Press Enter.

Step 6

Notice that the plab.txt file is present in the current directory.
