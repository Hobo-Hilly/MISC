 # this is a cheat sheet for arrays :) 

 Use Arrays

An array is a variable that can contain multiple values, which can be of the same or different types. Arrays do not have a size limit. Bash arrays use numbered indexes, and index starts with zero.

In this task, you will learn to use arrays. To do this, perform the following steps:
Step 1

Clear the screen by entering the following command:

clear

Letâ€™s first create a shell script with an array.

Type the following command:

gedit array.sh

Press Enter.

Step 2

Notice a new file with the name array.sh is displayed. Type the following statements:
Note: An array is created automatically when you define a variable in the following format: name[index]=value

#!/bin/bash

Car[0]='Honda'

Car[1]='Ferrari'

Car[2]='Toyota'

Car[3]='Nissan'

echo ${Car[1]}

You will display the value of index 1.

Step 3

Click Save to save the file. Then, close the file.

Step 4

Clear the screen by entering the following command:

You need to make the shell script executable. Type the following command:

chmod 777 array.sh

Press Enter.

Step 5

Notice that no output is displayed after the command execution. You will now execute the shell script. Type the following command:

./array.sh

Press Enter.

Step 6

Notice the outcome of the script that you run. The array runs successfully and generates the outcome.
