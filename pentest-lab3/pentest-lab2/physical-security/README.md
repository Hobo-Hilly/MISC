in Physical Security Attacks Related to Facilities

It is ironic that IT teams often believe that their only job is to protect the network and its systems. To do this, they will put in security controls to protect the network, systems, and devices. However, during this process, they forget to safeguard these from physical attacks. This ignorance could potentially cause severe security breaches.

Assume that a rogue user has gained access to a system on the network. This user was able to get inside the office as there were no proper security controls implemented. After gaining access to the system, the rogue user has the complete network opened to him and can perform several malicious tasks, such as installing a keylogger, copying confidential data, or running a utility in the background that will allow the user to access the system from a remote location. After performing any of these tasks, the user has access to the network and will not need to physically access the system anymore, as he would be able to control the system from a remote location.

Many organizations implement multiple levels of physical security controls, such as biometric locks, digital locks, cameras, and motion sensors. With the combination of multiple physical controls, physical security breaches can be prevented.

In this exercise, you will learn about physical security attacks related to facilities.

Task 1 - Piggybacking/Tailgating

Piggybacking or tailgating is one of the easiest methods to enter the premises. Tailgating is a social engineering act of gaining access to an electronically locked system or restricted area by following a user who has legitimate access, with the intention of accessing vulnerable information. When the legitimate user swipes his badge or enters the passcode to enter the building, you enter through the secured door before it closes by following the user.

Piggybacking or tailgating can be done in different ways, which are as follows:

    You can follow a single individual to enter a secured door.
    You can be part of a large group by pretending that you are one of them.
    You can convince an employee that it is OK to let you tailgate

Figure 1.1
Figure 1.1: Displaying a Piggybacking/Tailgating attack.

As part of the penetration testing process, you should review the physical security and focus on tailgating. You could suggest the implementation of a mantrap. In mantrap, only one person enters the mantrap, and the entry door closes. After the person authenticates himself or herself, the exit door opens. After the first person moves out of the exit door, the second person can enter the mantrap. Mantraps are installed to prevent tailgating and piggybacking.
Task 2 - Fence Jumping

Several organizations build fences around their offices for physical security. They are supposed to protect the offices from physical intrusions and prevent unauthorized personnel from entering the office.

Depending on the nature of work that an organization does, the fences can be of different styles, such as:

    Low-security fences: These are used for limiting traffic. They could also be used to prevent access to the premises.
    High-security fences: These are designed to be used with barbed wire so that an unauthorized person cannot climb the fence and jump into the premises.

Some organizations that require high security have fences rooted in the ground as well to prevent any digging from outside to the premises. It is quite possible if the fences are not rooted, someone can dig into the ground and create a tunnel inside the premises. Therefore, the fences are well-rooted inside the ground.

In addition to fences, offices can also have guard posts and patrolling guards to prevent an unauthorized person from jumping over the fence. During the penetration testing process, you should review the design of the fences and attempt a breach. If it is successful, then you have to suggest the mitigation plan for such a breach.
Task 3 - Dumpster Diving

Dumpster diving is another social engineering attack that uses the physical method of accessing vulnerable information. Papers sent to dumpsters or recycling bins from a company may contain highly sensitive information. Attackers screen those papers carefully to get valuable information. The attacker may target not only the papers but also electronic media or anything that can be useful to them.

Depending on the attack, attackers can look for the following information:

    User IDs
    Passwords
    Phone numbers
    E-mail IDs
    Bank account numbers
    Critical process and procedural information

As part of penetration testing, you should look for the above-mentioned information in a pile of papers that are considered junk. Users often print critical and confidential documents that are never collected and end up on a paper pile near the printer or in the dust bin. Another place to look for information is in the dust bin on a user’s workstation. If you happen to find any critical information, you can suggest to the organization to use a paper shredder. For hard drives, there are shredders available that can be used. Alternatively, a data wipe can be performed on the hard drives before disposing of them.

Task 4 - Lockpicking

Lockpicking is often ignored by security teams. As a penetration tester, you should know about different locks and should know how to pick them. Picking a lock is defined as opening a lock without using a key. If an unauthorized person is able to pick a lock, then they will have unauthorized access.

Depending on the types of locks, there are different types of picks that can be used:

    Half diamond shallow angles
    Half diamond steep angles
    Half round
    Full round
    Full diamond

During the penetration testing process, if you are able to successfully pick the locks, you should consider suggesting the following mitigation plans:

    Security cameras: Usually, lock picking does not leave any external damage, and therefore is hard to prove that it ever took place. A security camera can also work as a deterrent and provide proof in any legal proceedings.
    Anti-Lock Bumping Devices: You can also suggest anti-lock bumping devices. Anti-lock bumping devices prevent the thumb turn piece of a deadbolt from turning and opening the lock. If the thumb piece of a deadbolt does not rotate, the specially-cut key is unable to force the deadbolt, which is located inside the lock, from retracting back and opening the lock.
    Light Commercial Grade Locks: These locks are inexpensive and should be used in place of the normal locks. They are tested and approved by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) or Underwriters Laboratories (UL).
    Security pins: You can also suggest security pins, which even though do not prevent lock picking 100 percent but they do delay the process, which can discourage the person to continue. The security pins are designed to bind before they reach the lock’s shear line.

Task 5 - Lock Bypass

Lock bypass is a method of lock picking. You can use tools such as shove keys or simply put tape over the latch plate to prevent the door from closing. A lot of the time, when a door with an automatic latch plate needs to be opened frequently, users put something in the frame so that they don’t have to unlock the door over and over again. Shove keys are thin metal shims that you can hook over latches to disengage the lock. You can also bypass a lock by using the loading method using a credit card.

Figure 1.4
Figure 1.4: Loading method using a credit card.

In the loading method, you need to put the corner of the credit card between the door and the frame. After the corner goes inside, you need to bend the credit card towards the doorknob and then straighten the credit card perpendicular to the door.

Then, you need to give a little push to the door, and it should open without much effort.
Task 6 - Egress Sensor

Egress sensors are mainly used to open doors. If you have a door that is used by several people, you can install an egress sensor so that as a person walks by, the door is unlocked automatically.

As part of penetration testing, you can attempt to penetrate through the egress sensor and unlock doors. They should be put on secure areas, such as for an accounts team or data centers. To prevent the sensor from being penetrated, it is good to remove them or disable them.
