cheat sheet on a very basic understanding of bash.

te Bash Functions

You can use functions to trigger several commands. A function is a series of commands that can be executed by referring to the function name. Writing bash functions for the frequently used commands enables you to execute multiple commands by issuing one that calls the relevant bash function. You can use two methods to declare the bash functions.

Method 1

In this method, the function name is defined without any reserved word.

function_name () {

  commands

}

This method can also be written as:

function_name () { commands; }

Method 2

This method starts the function with the reserved word named function.

function function_name {

commands

}

This method can also be written as:

function function_name { commands; }

After the function name, with or without the reserved word, you need to use the {} to define the commands. The closing curly brace (}) closes the function. After defining a function, you need to call it by using its name.

In this task, you will write a bash function.

To write bash functions, perform the following steps:
Step 1

Clear the screen by entering the following command:
