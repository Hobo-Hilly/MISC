Create a Persistent Backdoor

Exploiting a system is just the beginning of penetrating a network. You need to find methods to keep you inside the system. You can use different methods for this purpose. For example, you can create a user account on a system and assign it to the local administratorâ€™s privileges. You can also use a shell to extract hashes for password extraction. One of the best methods to remain in a network is to create a persistent backdoor, which will allow you to extract information or allow you to get into the system.
