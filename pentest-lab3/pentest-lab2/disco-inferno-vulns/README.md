Eploiting Discovered Vulnerabilities

After you have established the initial connection with the victimâ€™s system, you should be able to exploit the vulnerabilities. For example, you can exploit the SMB vulnerabilities or any application-specific vulnerabilities. You should be able to perform several tasks, such as deploying a backdoor for the current session or even deploy a persistent backdoor. Pivoting is another major task that can be accomplished if you get hold of the right system.
