Search for Files

After exploiting a system, there will be situations when you would want to search and modify a few files. In this task, you will search for a file on the exploited Windows system. To do this, perform the following steps:
Step 1

Ensure that you are connected to PLABKALI01, and Meterpreter session is open.

Press Ctrl + l to clear the window. You should now see the meterpreter prompt.

Letâ€™s assume you want to search for a file named hosts. To do this, type the following command:

search -f hosts

Press Enter.
