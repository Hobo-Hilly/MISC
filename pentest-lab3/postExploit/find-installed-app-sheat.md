Find the Installed Applications

After compromising a host, you may want to find the applications that are installed. Meterpreter provides a module that helps you do this.

To find the installed applications on the exploited host, perform the following steps:
Step 1

Ensure that you are connected to PLABKALI01, and Meterpreter session is open.

Press Ctrl + l to clear the window. You should now see the meterpreter prompt.

Type the following command to find the installed applications:

run post/windows/gather/enum_applications

Press Enter.
