 # cheat sheet on keyloggers

Start a Keylogger

Using Meterpreter, you can start a keylogger, which is one of the most common activities attackers perform after exploiting a system. A victim does not know that his or her system has been exploited and, therefore, will continue to perform usual tasks, such as creating documents, accessing Websites, or even the banking Websites. The attacker can capture these keystrokes and misuse them as he likes.

In this task, you will start a keylogger. To do this, perform the following steps:
Step 1

Ensure that you are connected to PLABKALI01, and Meterpreter session is open.

Before you start the keylogger, type the following command:

getdesktop

Press Enter.

Step 2

The output of the getdesktop command is displayed.

Step 3

Letâ€™s start the keylogger with the keyscan_start command. Type the following:

keyscan_start

Press Enter.

Step 4

The keylogger now starts. You should now be able to capture the keystrokes.
Note: To view the captured keystrokes, you can use the keyscan_dump command. To stop the keylogger, use the keyscan_stop command.
