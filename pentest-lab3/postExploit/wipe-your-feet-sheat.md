Clear Tracks

In one of the previous tasks, you created a user account for Remote Desktop connectivity. There will be more evidence that you would leave behind. You need to ensure that you clear tracks before you move out of the system so that you are untraceable. To clear tracks, perform the following steps:
Step 1

Ensure that you are connected to PLABKALI01, and Meterpreter session is open.

Press Ctrl + l to clear the window. You should now see the meterpreter prompt.

You must have performed a series of activities on the exploited system. Most of them are likely to be logged. Therefore, it is better to clear the event logs on the exploited system. To do this, type the following command:

clearev

Press Enter.

Step 2

Notice the output. Several events are cleared from the Windows event log.

Letâ€™s verify the removal of events on PLABWIN810. Connect to PLABWIN810.

Right-click Windows charm and select Event Viewer.

Step 7

Connect to PLABKALI01.

Remember that you had created a user named plab for connecting to the exploited system using Remote Desktop. If this account is found on the system, the victim is likely to be convinced that the system was compromised. Therefore, it is better to remove the user account, plab.

Type the following command to remove the user:

run multi_console_command -r /root/.msf4/logs/scripts/getgui/clean_up__20200518.5135.rc

Press Enter.
Note: Notice this is the same command and the file number that was displayed in the output on the Task 8 - Step 3. The file number at the end of clean_up command will vary in your lab environment.

Note: You can connect to PLABWIN810 and verify that the user account is deleted.
