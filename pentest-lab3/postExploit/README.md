Complete Post Exploitation Tasks

First, exploiting a system is not an easy task. You discover a vulnerability but discover that the system that you want to exploit is already updated. You find another method to exploit the system in such cases. After a system has been exploited, the most important tasks of an attacker begin. You could be wanting to extract the information out of the system or perform lateral movement.

There are no hard and fast rules that a specific set of tasks must be performed. For example, you might want to enable remote connection with the exploited system or even start a keylogger so that you can capture critical information. It depends on what your requirements and intentions are. In the end, you want to remain undetected and leave no traces that you were in the system.
