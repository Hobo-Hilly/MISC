Perform an ARP Scan

When you are connected with a compromised system, which is part of a network, you can perform an ARP scan to find more systems on the network. To do this, perform the following steps:
Step 1

Ensure that you are connected to PLABKALI01, and Meterpreter session is open.

Press Ctrl + l to clear the window. You should now see the meterpreter prompt.

To perform the arp scan on a network for a given range, type the following command:

run post/windows/gather/arp_scanner RHOSTS=192.168.0.0/24

Press Enter.

Step 2

The ARP output is now displayed.

The task might take a while to complete.
