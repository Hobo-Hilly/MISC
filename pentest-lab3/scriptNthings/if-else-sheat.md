 # cheat sheet for if else statements

Use If…Else statements

The if…else statements are mainly used for making a decision and, therefore, are known as decision-making statements. However, there may be a scenario in which you will have to work with multiple conditions to choose from, then how to use the case…ecac statements.

In this task, you will learn to use if…else statements. To use the if…else statements, perform the following steps:




Ensure you have powered on all the devices listed in the introduction and connect to PLABKALI01.

In shell scripting, you can use three different types of if…else statements. They are the following:

    if...fi statement
    if...else...fi statement
    if...elif...else...fi statement

Let’s first create a new shell script in which you will compare two values of x and z and accordingly display the result. Type the following command to create a new file:

gedit if_fi.sh

Press Enter.

Step 2

Notice a new file is created with the name if_fi.sh. Type the following:

#!/bin/sh

x=10

z=20

if [ $x = $z ]

then

   echo "x is same as z"

elif [ $x -gt $z ]

then

   echo "x is more than z"

elif [ $x -lt $z ]

then

   echo "x is less than z"

else

   echo "None of them match"

fi

You need to make the shell script executable. Type the following command:

chmod 777 if_fi.sh

Press Enter.

Step 5

Notice that no output is displayed after the command execution. You will now execute the shell script. Type the following command:

./if_fi.sh

Press Enter.

In a scenario where you have multiple conditions, it is best to use case…esac statements. Create a new file with gedit, and name is case.sh. Type the following command:

gedit case.sh

Press Enter.

Step 8

A new file case.sh is displayed. Type the following:

#!/bin/sh

CAR="Honda"

case "$CAR" in

   "Ferrari") echo "Ferrari is quite expe    nsive."

   ;;

   "Jaguar") echo "I like Jaguar."

   ;;

   "Honda") echo "Honda is the car of the year."
