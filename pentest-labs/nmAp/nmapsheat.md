rm Website Enumeration using Nmap

There are different methods to enumerate a Website. For example, you can use a manual method using a Web browser. You can try:

http://www.plab.com/admin

After the URL, you can add a directory name, such as admin. You are likely to get one of the following responses:

    200 - OK
    401 - Unauthorized
    402 - Payment Required
    403 - Forbidden
    404 - Not Found

If the admin does not return 404 error but something else, such as 403, it indicates clearly that this directory exists.

You can also enumerate a Website using Nmap, which provides several scripts to enumerate different types of Websites, such as WordPress or Drupal.

1. To perform a Website enumeration, type the following command:

> nmap --script=http-enum 192.168.0.10

> press enter.

 note: this may take a moment to run.

2. Perform Server Message Block (SMB) Enumeration

~ SMB protocol is used by the operating systems, such as Windows, to share files and printers. It is known to be a weak protocol, and there have been various versions that have been included in different versions of Windows.


SMB1 - Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003
    SMB2 - Windows Vista SP1 and Windows Server 2008
    SMB2.1 - Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2
    SMB3 - Windows 8 and above, Windows Server 2012 and above



- you can use Nmap to perform SMB NetBIOS enumeration. To do this, type the following command:

- Note: SMB uses TCP ports 139 and 445. When using the nmap command, you should specify both ports.

nmap -v -p 139,445 192.168.0.10


A. nbtscan -r 192.168.0.0/24


- it gets to a certain ip and quits. says permission denied


B. You can check the security level of the SMB server using Nmap script   To do this, type the following command:

nmap -v -p 139,445 -script=smb-security-mode 192.168.0.10

> Notice the output as it details out the SMB security details.

note: this is spell is extremely powerful... pay attention
