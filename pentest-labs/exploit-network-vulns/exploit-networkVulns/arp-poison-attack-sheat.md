Conduct an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Poisoning Attack

ARP Poisoning or ARP Spoofing is a method of sending falsified ARP messages over a network. In this attack, the attacker links its system’s MAC address with the IP addresses of one or more legitimate systems on the network. The attacker can then receive messages that were intended to be sent to the owner of the IP address. However, instead of the owner, the attacker receives the messages. ARP spoofing can occur if both the parties, the attacker, and the victim, have the systems in the same broadcast domain.

To conduct an ARP Poisoning attack, perform the following steps:

''

- you will use Ettercap, which is a tool specifically designed for Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.



1. click Applications, select Sniffing & Spoofing, and then select ettercap-graphical.

2. click the Accept button in the Ettercap window.


''

before we proceed further with the ARP Poisoning attack, let’s first check the ARP table on PLABWIN810 system.

> Connect to PLABWIN810. Right-click the Windows charm and select Run.

>  get to cmd and run:

arp -a 


> notice that each system has a different MAC address.

''

3. notice the output in the bottom pane of Ettercap. The Unified sniffing is now starting.

4. click the hosts lists on the toolbar at the top.

5. notice several systems appear on the list.

> Click the Ettercap menu icon on the toolbar at the top.

6. click targets

7. select current targets

> Sections Target 1 and Target 2 are displayed.

> Click the Add button in section Target 1.

8. in the ettercap Input dialog box, add the following IP address in th   e IP address text box:8.

> click OK

> In the Target 1 section, an IP address is added

> In the Target 2 section, click Add


9. in the ettercap Input dialog box, add the following IP address in the IP address text box: 192.168.0.10

> click OK

> notice that the IP addresses are now added in the Target 1 and Target 2 sections.

''

 next you will perform the ARP Poisoning attack. Click Mitm menu icon on the icon bar at the top.

''

10. Select ARP poisoning

11. in the MITM Attack: ARP Poisoning dialog box, select Sniff remote connections and click OK

12. open a terminal window.

Type the following command:

ping 192.168.0.10

Press Enter.

13. the specified IP is now pinged.

''

Switch over to PLABWIN810.

''

1. cls

2. arp -a

> press enter

> notice that the MAC address for both 192.168.0.3 and 192.168.0.10 are the same. This means ARP Poisoning has been successful.

> Close the command prompt.

Conduct Man-In-The-Middle Attack Using Ettercap

Man-in-the-middle (MITM) is a type of attack that allows an attacker to position himself between two legitimate parties. The main goal of the attacker is to listen to the conversation between both parties and intercept the conversation, which can be used later.

MITM attacks can be performed using different methods, such as:

    ARP Poisoning
    ICMP Redirects
    DNS Poisoning

In this task, you will learn to conduct a MITM attack using Ettercap. To do this, perform the following steps:

''

1. Connect to PLABWIN810.

And close the Command Prompt window.

Click the Internet Explorer icon in the taskbar.


2. In the address bar, type the following URL:

http://192.168.0.10/bWAPP


> press enter



the login page is displayed. Type the following:

Click Login.


=========== SWITCH PLABKALI01 ============

> Switch over to PLABKALI01. Notice that you have been able to intercept the user credentials.

> Make a note of the user credentials and login URL.

> Minimize the Ettercap window. click the firefox ESR icon.

> The firefox window is displayed. In the address bar, type the following URL:

http://192.168.0.10/bWAPP

> Press Enter

1. you can now use the credentials that you had captured.

Login:

Click Login.

> notice that you have been able to use the captured credentials successfully.

> Make a note of the user credentials and login URL.

++++++++++++++ THE END ===============

> Close the Firefox ESR and Ettercap on PLABKALI01. Close the Internet Explorer window on PLABWIN810.
