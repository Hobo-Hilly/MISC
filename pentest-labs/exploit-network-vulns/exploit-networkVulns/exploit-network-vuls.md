 # ploiting the Network Vulnerabilities

Penetration Testing, or Pentest, is a simulated cyber attack to exploit the vulnerabilities in a network and the systems. It locates the vulnerabilities and then attempts to exploit them. A person conducting the pentest can attempt a breach of applications, protocols, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), servers, firewalls, and anything that can be exploited on a network. The core intent is to discover the vulnerabilities before an attacker from the outside world can and then exploit them to simulate the amount of damage that can be caused.
