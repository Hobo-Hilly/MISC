 # cheat sheet for DNS spoofing

''


There are many tools that are available for DNS spoofing. Ettercap, however, is one of the prominent tools that reduced the effort in conducting a DNS spoofing attack.

There are specific tasks that you need to perform to conduct this attack. At first, you need to modify the /etc/ettercap/etter.conf file. To do this, type the following command:

''

1. type: leafpad /etc/ettercap/etter.conf

> press enter

''

The etter.conf file is displayed.

''

2. Scroll down to the Linux section. You will need to remove # from bot   h the commands in the # if you use iptables section.

!!! Alert: Also remove the # from the IPv6 section. !!!

3. Press Ctrl +s to save the file. After the file is saved, close the f   ile.

Note: File can also be saved by clicking File and Save As option. If prompted to overwrite etter.conf file, click Yes.

4. You are back on the terminal window.

   Next, you need to start the Apache server running on Kali Linux   To do this, type the following command:

> service apache2 start

> press enter

> No error is produced, and Apache is now started.

5. Next, you need to edit the etter.dns file. To do this, type the   following command:

> leafpad /etc/ettercap/etter.dns 

> press enter

6. The etter.dns file is now displayed.

> Scroll down to the microsoft sucks section.

7. Replace the existing IP addresses with the following IP address   es:

192.168.0.3

192.168.0.3

192.168.0.3

8. Press Ctrl +s to save the file. After the file is saved, close    the file.

9. Next, let’s start Ettercap in GUI mode. In the previous tasks,   you started Ettercap using the Applications menu. You can also s  tart Ettercap in GUI mode from the command prompt. Type the foll  owing command:

> ettercap -G

> Press Enter.

!!!!Alert: If you encounter a segmentation fault please close all open windows and open terminal and enter: ettercap -G once more.!!




10. Ettercap now starts in GUI mode.

> Click Start/ Stop Sniffing . You will start sniffing later.

> Notice that the bottom pane states that sniffing has stopped.

> Click Scan for hosts.

> next, select Hosts list

11. The Host List is displayed. Select the gateway IP address, whi    ch is 192.168.0.250 and click Add to Target 2.

12. Now, select 192.168.0.1 and click Add to Target 1.

13.  Repeat the steps for the following IPs and add them to Target 1:

192.168.0.2

192.168.0.4

192.168.0.5


> Notice that the bottom pane lists four IP addresses that are added to Target 1.

14. Click Mitm and then select ARP poisoning.

15. In the MITM Attack: ARP Poisoning dialog box, select Sniff remote connections and click OK.In the MITM Attack: ARP Poisoning dialog box, select Sniff remote connections and click OK.

> click 'plugins' from the options

> Select Manage plugins from the list.

> The Plugins tab is displayed. Double-click the dns_spoof plugin.

> Notice that the bottom pane displays the Activating dns_spoof pl  ugin.

16. Now, click Start and select Start sniffing.


> Notice that sniffing has started, as shown in the bottom pane. T  he DNS spoofing has also started.

Perform DNS Spoofing Attack

DNS spoofing refers to an attack that diverts a domain name to an incorrect IP address. When a victim searches for a domain name, which is mapped to an incorrect IP address of the attacker’s system, the user is diverted to it. Therefore, the victim does not get to see the correct Website, but instead, the attacker’s Website is displayed.

For example, a victim attempts to connect to www.google.com. Instead of reaching www.google.com, the victim is redirected to a similar-looking Website on the attacker’s system. This is because, in DNS spoofing, www.google.com is mapped to the IP address of the attacker’s choice.

In this task, you will learn to perform a DNS spoofing attack. To do this, perform the following steps:
