perform a Slowloris Attack on a Website

Slowloris is an effective Denial-of-Service attack tool that uses low bandwidth. It triggers and sends partial HTTP requests to a Web server and continues sending to prevent sockets from being closed. The Web server cannot close the sockets on its own and continues opening the sockets as the requests are received from Slowloris. Finally, the requests sent by Slowloris overwhelm the Web server, and when the Web server’s maximum connection limit is reached, it starts to deny the legitimate requests. To prevent this attack, you can use some of the following methods:

    Use hardware-based load balancers that do not accept the partial http requests.
    Limit the connections to the Web server in a firewall, such as Iptables
    Configure the timeout in the Web server configuration

To perform the Slowloris attack on a Website, perform the following steps:

''

1. execute slowloris.perl script. To do this, type the following command:

> perl slowloris.pl -dns 192.168.0.10

Conduct an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Poisoning Attack

ARP Poisoning or ARP Spoofing is a method of sending falsified ARP messages over a network. In this attack, the attacker links its system’s MAC address with the IP addresses of one or more legitimate systems on the network. The attacker can then receive messages that were intended to be sent to the owner of the IP address. However, instead of the owner, the attacker receives the messages. ARP spoofing can occur if both the parties, the attacker, and the victim, have the systems in the same broadcast domain.


Ettercap

1. you will use Ettercap, which is a tool specifically designed for Man-In-The-Middle (MITM) attacks.

Click Applications, select Sniffing & Spoofing, and then select ettercap-graphical.

note: in cmd run command prompt window is displayed. Type the following command to check the ARP table:

arp -a
