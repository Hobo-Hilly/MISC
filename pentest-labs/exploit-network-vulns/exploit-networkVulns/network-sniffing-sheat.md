Track the Sniffing Network Interface Cards (NICs) on the Network

As part of penetration testing, you should also check if there are NICs on the network devices and servers that are configured in promiscuous mode. In this mode, a NIC can listen and read every packet that flows through the network. NICs should not be used with general-purpose servers, user systems, and network devices. You, however, should use this mode for network monitoring purposes.

In this task, you will learn to track the sniffing NICs on the network. To do this, perform the following steps:

''
from an open terminal..


1. To find the NICs that are in the promiscuous mode, type the following command.


> ettercap -TQP search_promisc

> press enter

> Ettercap starts to locate the NICs that are running in the promiscuou  s mode.

> Notice that it has not found any NIC in the promiscuous mode. Press C  trl + c to terminate the command.
