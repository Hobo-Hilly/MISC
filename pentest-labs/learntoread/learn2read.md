Explain False Positive

A false positive is a condition that is shown in a result when it actually does not exist. For example, a vulnerability may indicate that MySQL has a vulnerability, but it does not exist or is not considered a vulnerability. The vulnerability scan results can produce several false positives. A vulnerability scanner may show false positives due to several reasons:

    It is unable to recognize an executable or service.
    To cover up a vulnerability, you may have implemented a compensating control. Therefore, the vulnerability may be shown as false positive even though it is covered by a compensating control.
    The vulnerability scanner does not have updated definitions.
    The scanner configurations are not correct, and therefore, several services or configuration settings may be marked as false positives.

> as a pentester, you must be able to identify false positives. Each scan result should be researched and calculated, whether it is a false positive or not. You will not know about every vulnerability that you discover, but researching can certainly prevent wastage of hours of work.

mapping Vulnerabilities

After generating the list of vulnerabilities, you need to map them. In a network environment, there can be several targets that can have associated vulnerabilities. You may run more than one vulnerability scans. After you are done with the scans, you can collate the vulnerabilities in a single document and map them with the targets. You should update this document as and when you run a vulnerability scan.

1. When performing a penetration test, you need to prioritize the activities. Remember that the penetration tests are time-bound and cannot go on for an indefinite time. If penetration tests stretch more than required, then they might also end-up losing validity. For example, a penetration test could not be completed within the defined time due to a shortage of resources. 

You had only completed the vulnerability scan and found several vulnerabilities. After a month, you cannot assume that the vulnerabilities are still valid. It could be possible that the client must have run updates on the servers or devices. It could also be possible that the client must have installed a set of new applications. Therefore, some of the discovered vulnerabilities would have been closed while several new would have been introduced.

You must prioritize activities in penetration testing. There will be tasks that will be quick to complete; you can always do them first and get them out of the way. However, at the same time, there will be tasks that may not have a definite timeline. One such example is social engineering. You may also prioritize these activities so that they have enough time for completion.
