.. yes, you are correct ... this is exactly what it sounds like. a cheat sheet on rpcclient. remote procedure call client

(all ips are out of it-pro-tv-test-labs/ i.e. just practicing yo!)



1. how to connect

rpcclient 192.168.0.5 -U admin

- prompt for password
 > Passw0rd (we happen to have it for the lab)

 - notice that the rpcclient prompt appears. This indicates that you have connected!! : )


2. to display details type: srvinfo

- notice the output of the srvinfo command. It displays the IP address, type of operating system, its version, and so on.

3. Now find out the Security ID (SID) of the admin account. Type the following command: 
	
	lookupnames admin

 -notice that the SID for the admin account is now displayed. SID for the admin account ends with 1001.

> Note: If this was the built-in administrator account, then its SID will always end with 500. SID will never change even if you rename the administrator account.

> To clear the screen, press Ctrl + l.
  Note: The clear command does not work at the rpcclient prompt.



4. Now query the SID 500. Type the following command:

queryuser 500

Press Enter.

	- notice that the information regarding SID 500 is displayed.

> Note: You can scroll up to see the username for this SID. Even if the username was renamed, you would get to know it.


5. To enumerate uers, type the following command:

enumdomusers

> notice the list of users on the local system is displayed.


6. To enumerate the domaian groups, type the following command:

  enumalsgroups domain


7. now enumerate the builtin groups. Type the following command:

enumalsgroups builtin

> notice that the list of builtin groups is displayed.

you can also list the privileges that are known in this domain. Type the following command:

enumprivs

8. you can also list the SIDs for the local LSA. Type the following command:

lsaenumsid


> notice that the SIDs for the local LSA are now listed.

!!!!!!! Thats all for now. memorise these and life will be better. :)
