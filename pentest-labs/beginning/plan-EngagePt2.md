second half of Planning and Preparing for a penetration test engagement

starting at exercise #7 Explain Asset Categorization and Risk Assessment



1. explain asset categorization and risk assessment

Types of Assets:
	> servers
	> software
	> devices
	> the info in any format
	> services
	> people
	> intangibles: reputation or brand

> the assets typically have owners and custodians
	- the owner performs asset management and is responsible for
	  handling, disclosure, and destruction of the asset
	- decides the need-to-know purpose for the asset

> Custodian is responsible for portecting the data as per security
  requirements
	- custodian provides accessability of the assets to end-users
	- custodian also responsible for quality assurance and
	  data validation of the asset

A. types of assets...
> people: includes employees, cxs, and partners

> hardware: includes servers, desktops, laptops, and any devices
  that are owned by the organization

> software: includes operating systems and applications that are
  used for business purposes

> data: includes business and employee information

> physical environment: includes the physical infratstructure, which
  includes the business premise

> processes: include the processes and procedures that enable an organi  zation to run its business

> Third-parties: includes partners


B. Assest inventories


> asset inventories are critical are critical when figuring out what to  protect and how much to spend protecting it.

> asset inventories should be checked periodically to verify accuracy

> inventories SHOULD track details necessary for the following reasons:

	- Assets identification
	- Date of acquisition
	- security classification
	- descriptive details
	- asset location
	- information necessary for a backup and restore, disaster
          recovery
	- Asset owner and custodial information


B. Differnt Types of Risk Responses

	4 different types of risk responses:
	
> risk reduction - controls are used to reduce the
  liklihood/impact of the risk or minimize loss
	
> risk avoidance - removing the threat by using alternative 
  behavior to end the exposure

> risk transfer - pass risk onto 3rd party such as insurance company

> risk retention/acceptance - accepting athe risk outcome as necessary   to continuing the business goals and confirming monetary funds are
  available if required

	- the controls are classified as directive, deterrent, preventi          ve, compensating, detective, corrective, recovery. Examples:

> Technical controls - authentication, accesss control encryption, etc

> Procedural controls - security awarness, training, etc

> Physical controls - fences, doors, firs suppression, etc

> Leagal, regulatory and compliance - security policies, regulations
  etc


C. Tolerance to Impact

> testing is very likely to impact the network performance

> when you are testing you are responsible for making sure
  that the organizations business runs BAU with minimal to zero
  impact on the day to day operations.

''

!!!!!!!! Disclaimer: we do NOT guarantee anything ever. especially thisit says in the paperwork that we may knock down servers which is why it is so important to define this in the scope. ok. as you were. :) !!!!!

''

> this is why it's critical for the organization to identify the
  network devices and servers that are in scope or out of scope. 


	- ex: an internally hosted live web server can be brought down
          during penetration testing. it will impact its availability
          to the public.

	  therefore, you need to make sure that when defining the scope
          with the organization they understand the risk tolerance leve          ls
		
	 - ex: to ensure users are not impacted, you need to make sure
           they know it would be best to test at night or on the weeke            nds. || whenever traffic is light/ non exsistent on their se           rver.
	note: it will not increase the risk tolerance to the webserver


D. Risk Appetite

> this refers to the number of risks that an organization can tolerate

> it is the acceptance of the risks by the organizations keeping in
  mind the business objectives.

> the tolerance of risks should be weighed with the cost of closing the  risk. if the cost of closing the risk is more then the risk itself,
  then the organization can choose to tolerate the risk.



2. Explain Compliance-based Assements
''
- Compliance-based assessments are designed to meet rquirements of a sp  ecific law or standar. in most scenarios, the organization must be te  sted and certified by and authorized agency against the defined compl  iance-based assessment. 

- Not every organization needs to obtain a compliance-based certificati  on or pass the assessments. Many organizations define their security   policies that they use to ensure their infrastructure 
  security

''

A. Key Aspects of compliance-based Assessments and their Limitations

> compliance is assured through implementing various types of security   controls, which can be administrative, technical, physical, and opera  tional

> Each type of assesment defines the criteria that must be passed for
  completing the assessment. Penetration testing can be used to validat  e security controls.

NOTE: it's not necessary that every organization needs to opt for each
      of these assessments. each one is designed with a specific
      purpose.   

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS)

> PCI-DSS assesment is applicable to organizations that deal with
  credit,debit, and cash card transactions

> intended to protect cardholders so that their personal info cannont
  be misused

> defines strict parameters for the organizations so that the cardholde  ers' information can be protected



B. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

> HIPPA applies to health care providers and organizations

> designed to ensure the confidentiality of protected helath
  information (PHI). HIPPA is divided into 7 major standards

	- privacy rule
	- securoty rule
	- transactions and code sets(TCS) rule
	- unique identifier rule
	- breach notification rule
	- omnibus final rule
	- HITECH act 



SOX

> in the USA all public co.'s, financial and IT, must comply with the
  SOX assessments. It requires all business transactions to be saved
   for no less than 5 years

> does not specify how data must be stored but DOES specify what needs
  no be stored

Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) AKA Financial Modernization Act of 1999

> decrees that all financial organizations must share how their cx's
  is protected && shared

> also mandates the co's inform their cx's about sharing their personal
  information as well as an opt-out ability

> the co's then needs to take security precautions to make sure this 
  does not happen



C. Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) 140-2

   FIPS-2 is applicable to the hardware, software, and firmware solutio   ns. Any of these that use cryptography MUST pass FIPS 140-2
   
   this assessment is designed to insure high security for cx's

D. Limitations

   even though compliance-based assessments are designed for a specific   purpose, they do have limits:

	- compliance standard defines the rule and the guidelines to 
          complete the assessment
	
	- the organization must adhere to the rules and guidelines if 
          it needs to complete standard, you may have to conduct penetr          ation testing on the internal and public-facing network

	- Data isolation is critical and should be seperated from
          the rest of the network.

	- the scope only needs to test the ENVIRONMENT not the data,
          such as cardholder's data

	- if using cryptography, then the FIPS 140-2 must be adhered to		
	- storage and network must be segregated and provide limited
          access during penetration teseting

	-  if adhering to more than one standard, then then operations            and date must be segregated carefully.
	
		> ex: if the co. needs to be compliant with PCI-DSS and 		 HIPPA then information must be segregated so that 
	          there is zero overlap.
		
		  using this strategy, the organization can have one
                  standard for 1 env and the other 1 for the second env
