conducting Passive Reconnaissance for Vulnerabilities in a Network

Information gathering is critical in penetration testing. Without gathering information about the targets, the attackers may not know what to target. With the amount and type of information the attacker gathers, the attacker can form the strategy for penetration testing.

The attackers normally use Open source intelligence (OSINT) to obtain information that is available publicly. There is nothing wrong with collecting such information as it is not confidential or private. Anyone with some bit of skills can obtain information about the targets. There are various places one can look for information:

    Whois database
    Targetâ€™s Website
    Social media profiles of employees
    Google search results
    DNS information
    Blogs and public forums

A tool, such as Maltego, helps you with detailed Footprinting information about a Website.


        
task 1 - Use the WHOis Website

The WHOis Website is a Website that returns information about a domain name. For example, if you enter a domain name, such as practice-labs.com, WHOis will return the name and address of the domain's owner, which in this case, is Practice Labs. You can also use the whois command in Kali Linux. Using this command, you can find out information about a domain, such as:

    Registrar
    Server name
    WHOis Server
    Referral URL
    IP address range

You can find out a lot of information about a particular domain. This information can be further used in attacking a particular domain or a server.
