Exercise 9 Prepare for penetration test engagement

''
after scoping the penetration test and planning the engagement w/
the client. various activities must be performed. these activities
are crucial to streamline the over penetration test.

some of the key activities that must be performed before the
penetration test, are preparing the team, activity assignment, and
contingency planning.

''

1. Team Preperation

> there are certain key pointers that must be followed when proparing
the team for penetration testing

   - team must be crystal clear on in-scope targets and out of scope
     devices/servers/etc

   - team must all be CC on end objective

   - each team member should know their job and what the bigger picture     of the main overall objective at hand (DO YOUR JOB! FINISH!)

   - the end objective, at the end of the penetration testing, must be
     achieved and translated into an actionable report

   - every team member is meant to document ALL actions and ALL
     outcomes (tmux record)

   - team must have authorization for the test


   - the immediate sup contact info must be available/ the team memeber     s should be able to reach out to one another in case of trouble
     (group text for each project)

   - the team must be able to restore the original environment should
     something go wrong during testing.(BACKUPS BABY!)

> you must have the technical contact point of informatio form the 
  client side. info needs to be accessible for duration of testing

> ensure that the client has appraised the internal IT and Security
  teams about penetration testing

> you must inform the client the will take necessary back ups of
  any and all critical infrastructure

> the CLIENT must have the required backups to restore the system.

> YOU need to make sure the client doesn't make security control
  changes just before the penetration testing. as this will scew
  the results and make the test useless. 

> the idea is to test the current IT in an 'as-is' state.


2. Data Collection and Docuemntation

''
Data collections and documentation is a critical task in penetration
testing. here are some guidelines one must follow.

''
> every activity and its outcome must be documented

> data must be stored in a central repository with access to all team
  members

> the penetration test must be aligned to the defined objectives,
  and each tust must meet the CLIENT requirements. not YOUR req's

> each piece of documentation must be written in a clear and concise
  manner.

> each and every step to perform a task must be captured properly
  - should you ever need to reproduce results/outcomes you should 
    be able to do it step by step
   (TMUX RECORD + Screen Capture)

> only focus on documenting the in-scope activities.
  - anything out of scope should be escalated to proper person
  - However, it is crucial you DO NOT capture any out of scope activiti    es

> capture every detail in a test
  - more info = more opportunity and insights

> Ensure the original test data and docs are preserved securely
