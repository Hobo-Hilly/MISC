Extracting and Cracking the Password Hashes

There are multiple methods that you can use to extract passwords from a Windows system. Metasploit also offers a method to extract the hashes and then crack them. In this task, you will learn to extract and crack the password hashes.

To extract and crack the password hashes, perform the following steps:

''

1. Ensure that you are connected to PLABKALI01, and Armitage window is open.

> To extract the hashes, type the following command:

> run post/windows/gather/hashdump

> press enter

2. Notice that the passwords hashes have been extracted successfully.

> Windows, by default, is installed with a few user accounts. These user accounts are:

    Guest: Has a default relative ID (RID) of 501.
    Administrator: Has the RID of 500.
    Krbtgt: Has the RID of 502.
    DefaultAccount: Has the RID of 503.
    WDAGUtilityAccount: Has the RID of 504.
    defaultuser(): Has the RID of 100x.

> Other than these user accounts, you can always create as many user accounts as you like on a local system. However, it is important to note that the RIDs of the accounts cannot be changed. 

> This stands true even 
if you change the name of the user account. For example, the default Administrator account can be renamed to LocalHead. Even when the name is changed, its RID will always remain the same, and this allows an attacker to identify the accounts.

3. Highlight the hashes, right-click, and select Copy.

> Minimize the Armitage window.

get the hashes to a file via leafpad in the demo but of course we use vim.

2. save the file of hases as hashes.txt

> click save

3. create your own dictionary:

You will randomly add a few passwords. Even though there are several wordlists available in Kali Linux, you can also create your own.

Type the following:

password

Passw0rd

Password

Pass1234

1234Pass

P@ssw0rd

12345678

Press Ctrl + s to save the file

> The Save As dialog box is displayed. From the left pane, select Deskt  op. In the Name text box, type the following name:

> pass.txt

> click save


3. You will now use John the Ripper to crack the hashes. To do this, type the following command:

> john --wordlist=/root/Desktop/pass.txt --format=NT /root/Desktop/hash  es.txt

> press enter

note: the direcetories may vary, it depends on where you put all of you      r files. however most of this is stadard kali installed stuff.

> Within a few seconds, you are able to get the password for the user a  ccount Admin.
