Working with the Windows Commands

After you exploit a Windows system, there are several tasks that you can perform. Right from creating a file to uploading a malicious executable are possible.

To work with the Windows commands, perform the following steps:

''

> On the Meterpreter 1 tab, type the following command:

> pwd

> Press Enter.


!!!!!!  Alert: The output for the command will not be displayed immediately. There will be a few seconds delay.  !!!!!!



> notice that the output displays C:\Windows\system32


1. Letâ€™s create a directory named plab in PLABWIN810. Type the following command:

> mkdir c:\plab

> press enter

> Notice that the command has executed successfully.



========= SWITCH +++++++++++

''
Switch over to PLABWIN810. You will verify if the plab directory is created.

> The desktop of PLABWIN810 is displayed. Click the File Explorer icon.

> Double-click Local Disk (C:) in the right pane.

> Notice that the plab directory is not created.
''

============== SWITCH --------------

1. Switch back to PLABKALI01. Attempt to run the following commands:

> clear

> cls

> Notice that both commands provide errors. This is because you are not using the Windows command prompt.

2. To open a Windows command shell, type the following command:

> shell

> press eneter

> Notice that the Windows command shell is invoked.
 
Note: If you attempt to create a directory or run the cls command, you will succeed.

3. Enable a User Account

> When a session is established with Windows for exploitation, you can   also work with the user accounts. You can create user, delete, modify, or enable user accounts.

> To enable a user account, perform the following steps:

A. Right-click the Windows charm and select Computer Management.i

B. In the left pane, select Local Users and Groups. The right pane displays two containers: Users and Groups.

C. Double Click Users

D. The users within the Users container are displayed. Notice that t he Administrator account is disabled.

> Minimize the Computer Management window.

================SWITCH ++++++++++++++++++ 

Minimize PLABWIN810. Connect to PLABKALI01, and Armitage window is open.

Using the command prompt, you can always manipulate the Windows accounts. For example, you can execute the following command: net user guest /active: yes.

> This command will activate the guest user account. When you exploit a system, you can find out the user accounts existing on the system by using the net user command. 

> Assume this scenario in which an attacker activates the Guest user account and adds it to the local Administrators group. The owner of the exploited system will generally not imagine that the Guest user account holds the local administrator privileges.

> On the Meterpreter 1 tab, type the following command:
Note: Ensure that you are on the C:\Windows\system32 prompt. If not, enter the shell command to get into this prompt.

> net user administrator /active:yes

> Press Enter.


> Notice that you are prompted with an error stating that the password does not meet the complexity requirements.

4. You need first to reset the password so that it meets the password complexity policy. To reset the Administrator account password, type the following command:

> net user administrator Passw0rd

> Press Enter

5. The password has been reset.

> Once again, type the following command:

> net user administrator /active:yes

> press enter

> Notice that the administrator account is now active.

> Connect to PLABWIN810. Ensure that the Computer Management window is open.

Notice that the Administrator account is now enabled.
Note: If you still see the Administrator account disabled, refresh the window.

> Close the Computer Management window.
