 Exploiting the Desktop Systems Vulnerabilities

Just like the network, hosts systems, which could be servers or desktops running a specific operating system, are bound to have vulnerabilities. An operating system like Windows contains millions of lines of codes, and there have been several vulnerabilities that have been discovered. Linux, even though open-source, has lesser vulnerabilities than Windows.

Several security researchers and attackers discover new vulnerabilities. Whereas security researchers inform the companies owning the operating system, the attackers may take advantage of these vulnerabilities and exploit them. There are hundreds of exploits available in the Metasploit Framework, and they can be used to exploit these vulnerabilities.
