- During a penetration test, you will need to choose an attack technique to complete the task. In different environments, the attack technique will differ. Some of the common attack techniques used in penetration testing are:

- Social engineering - This attack sets the base for all other attacks. An attacker can use different methods, such as phishing, to trigger the attack.
   
-  Web application attacks - These could include SQL injection, XSS, XSRF, and many more types of attacks. These are applicable if you are performing a penetration test on a Web application.
   

- Session hijacking - This is specifically useful when you have unencrypted sessions going on. An attacker can perform session hijacking or man-in-the-middle attack.
    Password cracking - This involves some level of access to the server or system and then use various tools to crack the passwords.

- A private network is slightly more secure than the public network, which is visible to everyone. When breaking into a private network, the attacker must find various methods to connect. For example, the attacker may use social engineering and deploy malware by sharing a USB drive with a user.

its

Exploit is a method of delivering a payload to a victim’s system or a device. A payload is a code that runs on the victim’s system and connects back to the attacker’s system. For example, when you use Metasploit Framework, you deliver a payload to the victim’s system, and then the listener on your system waits for the payload to be triggered. After it triggers, a connection is made on the listener.

Some of the common examples of the payload are Meterpreter, backdoor, malicious DLLs, and trojans. Payloads can work in different ways. They can be self-dependent, which means that they get triggered on their own. Another method of working is that they wait for instructions from the attacker. In either case, they are present in the victim’s system.
Cross-compiling Code

A cross-compiled code is a code that is created and compiled on one platform, but it is executed on a different platform. For example, you create a custom exploit in Kali Linux, but this exploit will trigger a payload on a Windows system. The listener on the Kali Linux is used to wait for the incoming connection. When the payload is triggered, a connection is established with the listener running on Kali Linux.
Exploit Modification

An exploit may not work against a particular vulnerability if it has been patched. Application vendors continue to patch the vulnerabilities in their applications and operating systems. An original exploit may not work in this scenario. Therefore, as a pentester or an attacker, you need to find a way to see the changes that have been applied to the applications and operating systems and find vulnerabilities in them. In such a case, the exploit will need to be modified.
Exploit Chaining

Exploit chaining runs more than one exploit to launch an attack. These exploits can be used as a chain. This requires one exploit to finish its task before the next one triggers. Alternatively, the exploits can also be used in parallel. This means that multiple exploits can run in parallel, and each one has a task to finish.
Proof-of-Concept Development (Exploit Development)

Not all exploits are developed for malicious intents. As a pentester, you can also create your own exploit to exploit a vulnerability in an application and inform the company accordingly. Such exploit development is known as a proof-of-concept exploit development.
Social Engineering

Social engineering is the most common attack method that is widely used in almost all scenarios. In a social engineering attack method, the attacker can use different techniques, such as persuasion or show authority. The victim is convinced by creating trust, fear, sympathy, or even urgency using deception.

For example, you receive a call stating that your ATM card is blocked. If you are not aware of such social engineering methods, you are bound to panic. The caller tells you that he is calling from the bank and need your ATM pin so that he can reset the card once again. He also states that if you do not share the PIN, the card will be blocked forever. He is using urgency and fear to convince you. Because you are in a panic, you provide him the ATM card PIN. The social engineering attack is now complete. The next thing that is likely to happen is that your account gets debited with some amount of money.
