Using Lynis for System Vulnerability Scanning

Lynis is a built-in tool in Kali Linux that is a multi-purpose tool. It is designed to perform the following tasks:

    Security auditing
    Compliance testing
    Penetration testing
    Vulnerability detection
    System Hardening

It can perform several types of system auditing, such as system binaries, boot loaders, startup services, run level, loaded modules, kernel configuration, core dumps, and so on.

In this task, you will learn to use Lynis for system vulnerability scanning. To do this, perform the following steps:

''

1. first run the normal audit scan. Type the following command:

lynis audit system

press enter

The auditing process starts. Notice that it has already detected the operating system version, its hostname, and so on.

Note: The audit process will take a few minutes to complete..

> notice things are grouped by different catagories

> the audit process completes


- You will need to scroll up to review the results. Notice that there are vulnerabilities that are located. Lynis also provides a suggestion to close the vulnerabilities. For example, hardening the SSH configuration.

-  It has a setting PermitRootLogin set to Yes. Lynis audit suggests that it should be set to No.

Note: Take a few minutes and go through the audit report. If time permits, then you should use the following command to perform a full audit scan: lynis audit system -c
